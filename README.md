# event-keycode-project

<p> I am currently learning Javascript through the Udemy course Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0 - 2023 Revamp taught by <a href=https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/#instructor-1>Brad Traversy.</a>

I've completed 88 of 265 lessons thus far and this project came in the Event module.

Traversy provided a mini keycode project for us students to create a keycode generator modeled after <a href=https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode>Toptal's version.<a> 

I took this a step further to provide a word that begins with the letter that is pressed. While not relevant to key code information, I see this as a start to building out a children's learning game where the user can press a letter on the keyboard and get a word corresponding to that letter. 

While this project has that ability now, I hope to play with the styling, remove the keycode information, and generate an variety of words per letter at random.

This project offered an opportunity to combine everything we've learned in this course up until this point including, variables, data types, arrays and objects, functions, scope, logic and control flow, loops, iteration and array methods, DOM and events.
